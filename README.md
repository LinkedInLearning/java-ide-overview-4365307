Choosing the right IDE is one of the most important puzzles to solve as you kick off Java development. With many options on the market, how do you know which IDE is best for you? In this course, software developer and mathematician Terezija Semenski guides you through the options available, the tools you need, efficient coding, and much more. Terezija offers an overview of the most popular Java integrated development environments (IDEs), and then follows up with deep dives into IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, and Visual Studio Code. Each of these deep dives includes details on downloading and installation, navigation, debugging, and efficient coding. When you complete this course, youâ€™ll be able to confidently select the IDE that is best for you, which can make all the difference when it comes to making your Java development experience smoother.

You can find list of most popular IDE shortcuts [here](Shortcuts.md)

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
